4. Paste as secret value in GitHub
```

**3. RAILWAY_API_URL**
```
Your Railway deployment URL for health checks

```
**To find it:**
```bash
railway domain
```
Or check your Railway dashboard under the service deployments.

#### Optional (Recommended)

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions

**URL:** https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/settings/actions

**Configure:**

1. **Actions permissions:**
   - ‚úÖ Select: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

2. **Workflow permissions:**
   - ‚úÖ Select: "Read and write permissions"
   - ‚úÖ Check: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. Click **"Save"**

---

### Step 3: Configure Branch Protection (Recommended)

**URL:** https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/settings/branches

**Steps:**

1. Click **"Add branch protection rule"**
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable the following:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
     - Required approvals: 1
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Search and add these status checks:
       - `Lint`
       - `Type Check`
       - `Test`
       - `Build`
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

4. Click **"Create"** or **"Save changes"**

---

### Step 4: Verify Railway Environment Variables

Check that your Railway project has all required environment variables:

**Command:**
```bash
railway variables --environment production
```

**Required variables:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=<supabase-connection-string>
SUPABASE_URL=<supabase-project-url>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<supabase-service-key>
REDIS_URL=<railway-redis-url>
SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=<your-key>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

If any are missing, add them:
```bash
railway variables set KEY=value --environment production
```

---

### Step 5: Test the Pipeline

**Option A: Test via Pull Request (Recommended)**

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/verify-ci-pipeline

# Make a small change
echo "# CI/CD Pipeline Enabled ‚úÖ" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test(ci): verify GitHub Actions pipeline"
git push -u origin test/verify-ci-pipeline

# Create PR on GitHub
gh pr create --title "test(ci): verify CI/CD pipeline" --body "Testing the new CI/CD setup"
```

**What to verify:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/actions
2. You should see workflows running:
   - ‚úÖ PR Quality Checks
   - ‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline (for the branch)
3. Check the PR - status checks should appear
4. All checks should pass ‚úÖ

**Option B: Watch Main Branch Deployment**

The CI/CD pipeline should already be running from the commit we just pushed!

Check: **https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/actions/runs**

Look for the workflow run from commit `e623f3a`

---

## üß™ Verification Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status

**URL:** https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/actions

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow run appears for commit e623f3a
- ‚úÖ Jobs: Install ‚Üí Lint ‚Üí Type Check ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Build
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deploy job will SKIP (missing secrets) - THIS IS EXPECTED

### 2. Check Workflow Files

**URL:** https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/tree/main/.github/workflows

**Expected files:**
- ‚úÖ ci.yml (Main CI/CD pipeline)
- ‚úÖ pr-checks.yml (PR quality checks)
- ‚úÖ dependencies.yml (Weekly updates)
- ‚úÖ validate.yml (Workflow validation)

### 3. Verify Railway Deployment

After adding the required secrets and the deploy job succeeds:

```bash
# Check Railway deployment status
railway status

# Test the health endpoint
curl https://your-api.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-15T..."}
```

---

## üìä What Happens Next

### On Every Push to Main:
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Run lint (parallel)
3. ‚úÖ Run type-check (parallel)
4. ‚úÖ Run tests (parallel)
5. ‚úÖ Build all packages
6. ‚úÖ Deploy to Railway (after secrets configured)
7. ‚úÖ Verify deployment health
8. ‚úÖ Run security audit

### On Every Pull Request:
1. ‚úÖ Validate PR title (conventional commits)
2. ‚úÖ Detect changed files
3. ‚úÖ Run tests only for changed code
4. ‚úÖ Comment coverage report
5. ‚úÖ Check bundle size
6. ‚úÖ All checks must pass before merge

### Weekly (Every Monday 9 AM UTC):
1. ‚úÖ Check for outdated dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Run security audit
3. ‚úÖ Create GitHub issues if updates needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deploy Job Skips

**Symptom:** Deploy job shows "Skipped" in Actions
**Cause:** Missing Railway secrets
**Fix:** Add RAILWAY_TOKEN, RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID, RAILWAY_API_URL to GitHub secrets

### Issue: Tests Fail

**Symptom:** Test job fails
**Check:**
```bash
# Run locally first
npm run test

# Check specific workspace
cd apps/api && npm test
```

### Issue: Lint Errors

**Symptom:** Lint job fails
**Fix:**
```bash
# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Commit fixes
git add .
git commit -m "style: fix linting issues"
```

### Issue: Health Check Fails

**Symptom:** Deployment succeeds but health check fails
**Check:**
1. Verify `/health` endpoint exists in API
2. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
3. Verify RAILWAY_API_URL is correct
4. Test manually: `curl https://your-api.up.railway.app/health`

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Once all secrets are configured, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check GitHub Actions
open https://github.com/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project/actions

# 2. Check Railway deployment
railway status

# 3. Test the API
curl https://your-api.up.railway.app/health

# 4. Check coverage (if Codecov configured)
open https://codecov.io/gh/ck123cabz/website-scraper-project
```

You'll know everything is working when:

- ‚úÖ All GitHub Actions jobs pass
- ‚úÖ Deploy job completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Health check returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Railway shows latest deployment
- ‚úÖ Coverage reports appear on Codecov
- ‚úÖ Can merge PRs only after checks pass
