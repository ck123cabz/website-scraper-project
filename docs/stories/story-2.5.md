# Story 2.5: Worker Processing & Real-Time Updates

Status: Ready for Merge

## Story

As a system,
I want to process URLs via BullMQ workers with real-time database updates,
so that dashboard shows live progress and logs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. BullMQ worker configured to process jobs from queue
2. Worker concurrency: 5 concurrent URLs (respects ScrapingBee rate limits)
3. Processing flow per URL: Fetch → Extract → Pre-filter → Classify (if PASS) → Store → Update → Log
4. Database updates trigger Supabase Realtime events (dashboard listens)
5. Job status auto-updates: "pending" → "processing" → "completed"
6. Pause/resume support: check job status before processing next URL
7. Graceful shutdown: finish current URLs before stopping
8. Error handling: failed URLs don't stop job, logged with details
9. ScrapingBee rate limit handling: 429 error → pause 30s, retry
10. Job completion: status "completed", completion timestamp, summary stats

### Review Follow-ups (AI)

#### Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)

- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Implement complete graceful shutdown - Call `await this.worker.close()` in `onModuleDestroy()` method (apps/api/src/workers/url-worker.processor.ts:571-590) - AC2.5.7 **[FIXED]**
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Add environment variable validation at startup - Validate SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, REDIS_URL, SUPABASE_URL before `app.listen()` (apps/api/src/main.ts:14-35) - NFR002-R1 **[FIXED]**
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Enable NestJS shutdown hooks - Add `app.enableShutdownHooks()` call in main.ts before listen (apps/api/src/main.ts:45) - AC2.5.7 **[FIXED]**

#### High Priority (Should Fix Before Production)

- [x] [AI-Review][MED] Implement pause/resume job database updates - Replace console.log stubs with Supabase client updates in pauseJob() and resumeJob() (apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts:81-113) - AC2.5.6 **[FIXED]**
- [x] [AI-Review][MED] Add Supabase Realtime integration test - Create integration test with test Supabase project to verify events fire (apps/api/src/workers/__tests__/integration/realtime.integration.spec.ts) - AC2.5.4 **[FIXED]**

#### Nice to Have (Technical Debt)

- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Make worker concurrency configurable - Use `process.env.WORKER_CONCURRENCY || 5` instead of hardcoded value (apps/api/src/workers/url-worker.processor.ts:32)
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Consolidate retry logic to shared utility - Extract `isTransientError()` to packages/shared/src/utils/retry.ts to eliminate duplication
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Replace console.log with Logger service - Inject NestJS Logger in QueueService for structured logging (apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts:19,81,92)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Worker Architecture:**
- BullMQ worker with `@Processor('url-processing-queue')` decorator
- Concurrency: 5 concurrent URLs (respects ScrapingBee 10 req/sec rate limit)
- Processing pipeline: Fetch → Extract → Pre-filter → Classify → Store → Update → Log
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM handling (finish current URLs before stopping)
- Isolated error handling per URL (failed URLs don't crash entire job)

**Processing Flow Per URL:**
1. Update job: `current_url`, `current_stage = 'fetching'`, `current_url_started_at`
2. **ScrapingBee Fetch**: Call ScrapingBee API with JS rendering enabled
3. Update `current_stage = 'extracting'`
4. **Content Extraction**: Extract title, meta description, body text (limit 10K chars)
5. Update `current_stage = 'filtering'`
6. **Pre-Filter**: Call `PreFilterService.filterUrl()` (Story 2.3)
   - If REJECT: Skip LLM, store result with `classification_result = 'rejected_prefilter'`, continue
   - If PASS: Proceed to classification
7. Update `current_stage = 'classifying'`
8. **LLM Classification**: Call `LlmService.classifyUrl()` (Story 2.4)
   - Try Gemini first, fallback to GPT on failure
   - Track tokens, calculate cost
9. **Store Result**: Insert to `results` table with all fields populated
10. **Update Job**: Increment counters (`processed_urls`, `successful_urls` or `failed_urls`), update progress, rates
11. **Log Activity**: Insert to `activity_logs` with severity, message, timestamp
12. **Realtime Broadcast**: Database changes trigger Supabase Realtime events automatically

**Job Lifecycle States:**
- `pending` → Job created, URLs queued, not started
- `processing` → Worker actively processing URLs
- `paused` → User paused, current URL completes, next URL not started
- `completed` → All URLs processed, final stats calculated
- `cancelled` → User cancelled, results preserved

**Retry Strategy:**
- Transient errors: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Retry triggers: Network timeouts, ScrapingBee 429 rate limit, 503 service unavailable
- No retry: 401 auth, 400 bad request, invalid JSON, permanent API errors
- ScrapingBee 429 special handling: Pause 30s, retry (respects rate limits)

**Rate Limiting:**
- ScrapingBee: Max 10 req/sec (250K credits/month)
- Worker concurrency: 5 URLs (stays under 10 req/sec with delays)
- Target: 20 URLs/min average (accounting for 2s delays between requests)
- Gemini: 15 RPM free tier (upgrade to 300 RPM paid if needed)
- GPT: 500 RPM tier 1 (sufficient for fallback usage)

**Real-Time Updates Pattern:**
- Worker writes to Supabase database (jobs, results, activity_logs tables)
- Supabase automatically broadcasts changes via Realtime subscriptions
- Epic 1 dashboard subscribes to table changes, updates UI immediately
- No WebSocket implementation needed - Supabase handles it

**Cost Tracking:**
- Per-URL cost calculated in LlmService (Story 2.4)
- Worker aggregates: `total_cost`, `gemini_cost`, `gpt_cost` on jobs table
- Update after each URL: `job.total_cost += result.llm_cost`
- Final stats on completion: avg cost per URL, savings via pre-filtering

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Worker module at `apps/api/src/workers/` (new directory for Story 2.5)
- Integrates existing modules: JobsModule (2.1), QueueModule (2.1), ScraperModule (new), PreFilterService (2.3), LlmService (2.4)
- Follows NestJS module organization: feature-based, injectable services
- Database schema extends Story 2.1 foundation (jobs, results, activity_logs tables)
- Shared types in `packages/shared/src/types/` for cross-app consistency

**New Components for Story 2.5:**
```
apps/api/src/
├── workers/
│   ├── workers.module.ts          # Worker module registration
│   ├── url-worker.processor.ts    # Main BullMQ worker processor
│   └── __tests__/
│       └── url-worker.spec.ts     # Worker unit tests
├── scraper/

│       └── scraper.service.spec.ts
└── queue/
    └── queue.service.ts           # Add job control methods (pause/resume)
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Story 2.1**: Uses BullMQ queue, Supabase client, database tables (jobs, results, activity_logs)
- **Story 2.2**: Processes jobs created by bulk URL upload endpoint
- **Story 2.3**: Calls PreFilterService to reduce LLM calls
- **Story 2.4**: Calls LlmService for classification after pre-filter passes
- **Epic 1**: Worker writes trigger Realtime events for dashboard updates

**Lessons Learned from Previous Stories:**

**From Story 2.2 (Bulk URL Upload - Approved):**
- ✅ Use atomic database operations (Postgres RPC functions, not manual transactions)
- ✅ Implement comprehensive input validation with class-validator decorators
- ✅ Sanitize all error messages before returning to client (no internal details)
- ✅ File path validation and cleanup (validate paths, cleanup temp files in finally blocks)
- ✅ URL protocol whitelist (reject javascript:, data:, file: schemes)

**From Story 2.3 (Pre-Filtering - Complete, Security Hardened):**
- ✅ Environment-aware config loading (CONFIG_PATH env var for production, fallback for dev)
- ✅ Validate external config files with safe-regex (prevent ReDoS vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation (null/undefined/empty checks at service boundaries)
- ✅ Sanitize inputs before logging (length limits, strip control characters)
- ✅ Create database migrations in repository (supabase/migrations/)
- ✅ Unit test coverage >85% with real-world test cases
- ✅ Performance optimization: pre-compile patterns, early exit on match

**From Story 2.4 (LLM Classification - Ready for Review):**
- ✅ Environment variables for all API keys (never hardcode, mask in logs)
- ✅ Validate external API responses with Zod schemas before using
- ✅ Implement timeout protection (30s for LLM calls, trigger fallback)
- ✅ Log detailed errors server-side, return generic messages to client
- ✅ Retry logic only for transient errors (not auth failures or bad requests)
- ✅ Track and log all API costs for monitoring
- ✅ Mock external API clients in unit tests (Gemini, OpenAI)
- ✅ Test all error paths: timeout, rate limit, invalid response, auth failure

**Security Patterns to Apply:**
- Always use environment variables for API keys (SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Validate all external API responses before using (schema validation)
- Implement timeout handling for all external API calls (prevent hanging)
- Sanitize all inputs before logging (URL length limits, strip control characters)
- Use retry logic only for transient errors (network, rate limits, 503)
- No retry on permanent errors (401, 403, 400, invalid responses)
- Track errors with context but return generic messages to clients

**Testing Patterns to Apply:**
- Mock all external API clients (ScrapingBee, Gemini, OpenAI, Supabase)
- Test full processing pipeline end-to-end with mocked APIs
- Test pause/resume job control (job status checks prevent processing)
- Test retry logic with transient errors (network timeout, 429)
- Test graceful shutdown (SIGTERM handling, finish current URLs)
- Test isolated error handling (one URL failure doesn't stop job)
- Integration tests with real Supabase Realtime (verify events fired)

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- UrlWorkerProcessor.processUrl() with all pipeline steps mocked
- ScraperService.fetchUrl() with mock axios responses (success, 404, 429, timeout)
- ScraperService.extractContent() with various HTML structures
- Retry logic: transient error → success after retry, permanent error → fail fast
- Job status checks: paused job skips processing, cancelled job skips processing
- Result storage: all fields populated correctly
- Job updates: counters incremented, progress calculated, costs aggregated
- Activity logging: all log entries with correct severity

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Happy Path**: Create job with 10 URLs → Worker processes all → Verify results in database, all counters correct
2. **Pre-Filter Integration**: 10 URLs (5 filterable, 5 passable) → Verify 5 rejected (no LLM), 5 classified
3. **LLM Fallback**: Mock Gemini timeout → Verify GPT called, result stored with 'gpt' provider
4. **Pause/Resume**: Start job → Pause after 3 URLs → Verify stops → Resume → Verify completes
5. **ScrapingBee 429**: Mock 429 response → Verify 30s pause, retry succeeds
6. **Error Isolation**: One URL fails permanently → Job continues with remaining URLs
7. **Supabase Realtime**: Process URLs → Subscribe to changes → Verify events fired for job updates, result inserts, log inserts
8. **Job Completion**: Process all URLs → Verify status = "completed", completed_at set, final stats calculated
9. **Graceful Shutdown**: Start job → Send SIGTERM → Verify current URL completes, worker stops gracefully
10. **Performance**: 100 URLs → Verify avg 20 URLs/min, memory stable, no leaks

**Mock Data Strategy:**
- **Mock URLs**: 20 test URLs across categories (company blogs, news sites, social media, e-commerce, forums)
- **Mock ScrapingBee Responses**: Pre-defined HTML content for classification testing (suitable sites, non-suitable sites)
- **Mock LLM Responses**: Pre-defined suitable/not_suitable classifications with confidence scores
- **Test Database**: Use Supabase test project or local Postgres instance (isolated from production)

**External API Mocking:**
- **ScrapingBee**: Mock with nock (intercept axios HTTP requests), return predefined HTML or error responses
- **Gemini API**: Mock via LlmService test doubles (already tested in Story 2.4)
- **GPT API**: Mock via LlmService test doubles (already tested in Story 2.4)
- **Supabase Realtime**: Test with real Supabase test project (Realtime hard to mock effectively, use isolated test database)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- **Processing Rate**: 20 URLs/min minimum (with 2s delays between requests)
- **ScrapingBee Fetch**: 2-5 seconds avg (depends on target site, JS rendering time)
- **Pre-Filter**: <100ms per URL (from Story 2.3, achieved <1ms)
- **LLM Classification**: 2-7 seconds avg (Gemini 2-5s, GPT 3-7s from Story 2.4)
- **Total per URL**: 5-15 seconds avg (fetch + filter + classify + store)
- **Memory Usage**: Worker memory <512MB stable, no leaks over 1000 URLs
- **Database Write**: <200ms per insert/update (from NFR002-P5)

**Review Follow-up Fixes (2025-10-15):**
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented complete worker.close() logic in onModuleDestroy() with error handling (apps/api/src/workers/url-worker.processor.ts:572-590)
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Added validateEnvironment() function that checks all required env vars before app.listen() (apps/api/src/main.ts:14-35)
- ✅ **Shutdown Hooks**: Enabled app.enableShutdownHooks() for SIGTERM handling on Railway deployments (apps/api/src/main.ts:45)
- ✅ **Pause/Resume DB Integration**: Replaced console.log stubs with Supabase client updates in pauseJob() and resumeJob() (apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts:81-113)
- ✅ **Realtime Integration Test**: Created comprehensive test suite with 5 test scenarios covering jobs, results, and activity_logs tables (apps/api/src/workers/__tests__/integration/realtime.integration.spec.ts)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: All 94 unit tests passing, 3 graceful shutdown test cases added, TypeScript build succeeds

**Next Steps for Deployment:**
1. Configure SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY in production environment
2. Test worker with real ScrapingBee API and Supabase Realtime
3. Monitor processing rate and adjust concurrency if needed
4. Verify graceful shutdown on Railway deployment (environment validation will catch missing vars early)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** CK
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 2.5 delivers a well-structured worker processing implementation with excellent test coverage (90 passing tests, 109 total) and proper integration of ScrapingBee, pre-filtering, and LLM classification services. The code demonstrates strong architecture patterns from NestJS and BullMQ best practices.

However, **critical production-readiness issues** have been identified that must be addressed:
1. **[HIGH]** Graceful shutdown implementation is incomplete - worker doesn't actually wait for jobs to finish
2. **[HIGH]** Missing environment variable validation at startup
3. **[MED]** Pause/resume functionality is stubbed out, not fully implemented
4. **[MED]** Missing Railway deployment health checks (SIGTERM handler)
5. **[MED]** No integration test coverage for Supabase Realtime events

The implementation correctly follows the processing pipeline (Fetch → Extract → Pre-filter → Classify → Store → Update → Log) and has robust error handling per URL, but production deployment concerns prevent approval at this time.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity Issues

**ISSUE-1: Incomplete Graceful Shutdown Implementation** ⚠️
- **Location:** apps/api/src/workers/url-worker.processor.ts:571-577
- **Finding:** `onModuleDestroy()` only sets a flag but doesn't actually wait for jobs to complete. BullMQ Worker requires explicit `worker.close()` call.
- **Impact:** Railway deployments will interrupt mid-processing URLs, causing job failures
- **Best Practice Violated:** BullMQ documentation requires: `await worker.close()` for graceful shutdown
- **AC Impacted:** AC2.5.7 (Graceful shutdown: finish current URLs before stopping)
- **Recommended Fix:**
  ```typescript
  async onModuleDestroy() {
    this.logger.log('Graceful shutdown initiated...');
    this.isShuttingDown = true;

    // Access the worker instance from BullMQ and close it
    // The WorkerHost provides access to the worker
    if (this.worker) {
      await this.worker.close();
      this.logger.log('Worker closed gracefully');
    }
  }
  ```
- **Reference:** BullMQ docs - https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/workers/graceful-shutdown

**ISSUE-2: Missing Environment Variable Validation** ⚠️
- **Location:** apps/api/src/main.ts (not reviewed, but inferred from app.module.ts)
- **Finding:** No startup validation for critical environment variables (SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, REDIS_URL, SUPABASE_URL)
- **Impact:** Application starts successfully but fails at runtime when processing jobs
- **Security Pattern Violated:** From Story 2.2/2.3/2.4 lessons - validate environment at startup
- **AC Impacted:** NFR002-R1 (Reliability - fail fast on misconfiguration)
- **Recommended Fix:** Add environment validation in `main.ts` before `app.listen()`:
  ```typescript
  const requiredEnvVars = ['SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY', 'GEMINI_API_KEY', 'OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REDIS_URL', 'SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY'];
  const missing = requiredEnvVars.filter(v => !process.env[v]);
  if (missing.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variables: ${missing.join(', ')}`);
  }
  ```

#### Medium Severity Issues

**ISSUE-3: Pause/Resume Job Controls Not Implemented** 📋
- **Location:** apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts:77-93
- **Finding:** `pauseJob()` and `resumeJob()` methods are stubbed with console.log, not implemented
- **Impact:** Dashboard pause/resume buttons won't work, users can't control job execution
- **AC Impacted:** AC2.5.6 (Pause/resume support: check job status before processing next URL)
- **Note:** Worker DOES check job status (line 61-66 in url-worker.processor.ts), but QueueService needs to update database
- **Recommended Fix:**
  ```typescript
  async pauseJob(jobId: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.supabaseClient
      .from('jobs')
      .update({ status: 'paused' })
      .eq('id', jobId);
  }

  async resumeJob(jobId: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.supabaseClient
      .from('jobs')
      .update({ status: 'processing' })
      .eq('id', jobId);
  }
  ```

**ISSUE-4: Missing SIGTERM Signal Handler for Railway**
- **Location:** apps/api/src/main.ts (inferred)
- **Finding:** No explicit SIGTERM signal handler registered
- **Impact:** Railway sends SIGTERM on deployment, but NestJS `enableShutdownHooks()` must be called
- **AC Impacted:** AC2.5.7 (Graceful shutdown for Railway deployments)
- **Best Practice:** NestJS requires `app.enableShutdownHooks()` to listen for SIGTERM
- **Recommended Fix:** In `main.ts`:
  ```typescript
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.enableShutdownHooks(); // Critical for Railway deployments
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3001);
  ```
- **Reference:** NestJS Lifecycle Events - https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/lifecycle-events#application-shutdown

**ISSUE-5: No Integration Test for Supabase Realtime**
- **Location:** Test files (apps/api/src/workers/__tests__/)
- **Finding:** Story claims "integration tests require real Supabase connection" but AC2.5.4 mandates Realtime event verification
- **Impact:** Can't verify Realtime events actually fire on database updates
- **AC Impacted:** AC2.5.4 (Database updates trigger Supabase Realtime events)
- **Testing Gap:** Unit tests mock Supabase, but Real time is hard to mock - need real test
- **Recommended Fix:** Create integration test with test Supabase project:
  ```typescript
  it('should trigger Realtime event on job update', async () => {
    const subscription = supabase
      .channel('jobs')
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'jobs' }, (payload) => {
        expect(payload.new.processed_urls).toBe(1);
        done();
      })
      .subscribe();

    await worker.process(mockJob);
    // Wait for Realtime event...
  });
  ```

#### Low Severity Issues / Code Quality Notes

**CODE-1: Worker Concurrency Hardcoded**
- **Location:** apps/api/src/workers/url-worker.processor.ts:32
- **Finding:** Concurrency set to 5 is hardcoded, should be configurable via environment variable
- **Impact:** Can't adjust concurrency for different environments (dev: 1, prod: 5)
- **Recommended:** Use `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` env var with fallback to 5

**CODE-2: Missing Structured Logging Configuration**
- **Finding:** Using console.log in QueueService instead of NestJS Logger
- **Location:** apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts:19, 81, 92
- **Impact:** Inconsistent logging, harder to parse in Railway logs
- **Recommended:** Inject Logger service and use structured logging

**CODE-3: Retry Logic Duplicated Between ScraperService and Worker**
- **Location:** apps/api/src/scraper/scraper.service.ts:305-336 and url-worker.processor.ts:493-527
- **Finding:** Both files implement `isTransientError()` with identical logic
- **Impact:** Code duplication, maintenance burden
- **Recommended:** Extract to shared utility in `packages/shared/src/utils/retry.ts`

**Summary:** 7/10 PASS, 2/10 PARTIAL, 1/10 FAIL

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Unit Test Coverage:** ✅ Excellent (90 passing tests across 5 test suites)
- ScraperService: 26 tests (mocked axios, HTML parsing, error scenarios)
- QueueService: 17 tests (queue operations, pause/resume stubs)
- UrlWorkerProcessor: 7 tests (mocked pipeline, pause detection)
- PreFilterService: Covered in Story 2.3
- LlmService: Covered in Story 2.4

**Integration Test Gaps:** ⚠️
- Missing: Supabase Realtime event verification (ISSUE-5)
- Missing: End-to-end test with real ScrapingBee API (noted in completion notes)
- Missing: Graceful shutdown SIGTERM test

**Performance Testing:** Not executed (Task 12.10 marked complete but no evidence)

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Strengths:**
- Proper NestJS module structure (WorkersModule, ScraperModule)
- Dependency injection correctly used (SupabaseService, ScraperService, PreFilterService, LlmService)
- BullMQ `@Processor` decorator pattern follows NestJS conventions
- Error isolation per URL prevents cascading failures
- Database schema matches Epic 2 tech spec (jobs, results, activity_logs tables)

⚠️ **Concerns:**
- Graceful shutdown pattern incomplete (missing `worker.close()` call)
- Environment validation not enforced at startup
- Pause/resume not integrated with database (stubbed methods)

### Security Notes

✅ **Applied Security Patterns from Stories 2.2, 2.3, 2.4:**
- ✅ Environment variables for API keys (SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- ✅ Input sanitization before logging (URL length limits line 58, error sanitization line 266-283)
- ✅ Error message sanitization (remove API keys, limit length, strip control characters)
- ✅ Retry logic only for transient errors (isTransientError at line 533-565)
- ✅ No API keys in logs (masked in scraper.service.ts line 272)

⚠️ **Security Gap:**
- Missing startup validation for environment variables (ISSUE-2) - could leak errors revealing infrastructure details

### Best-Practices and References

**NestJS Patterns Applied:**
- ✅ `@Injectable()` decorator for services
- ✅ `implements OnModuleDestroy` for lifecycle hooks
- ⚠️ Missing `app.enableShutdownHooks()` in main.ts (required for SIGTERM)
- ✅ `@OnWorkerEvent` decorators for BullMQ events (line 582-595)

**BullMQ Patterns Applied:**
- ✅ Worker extends `WorkerHost` for type safety
- ✅ Concurrency configured in `@Processor` decorator
- ⚠️ Missing explicit `await worker.close()` in shutdown handler
- ✅ Error event listeners attached (line 588-595)
