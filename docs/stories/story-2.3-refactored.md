# Story 2.3: Layer 1 Domain Analysis (Pre-Scrape) - REFACTORED

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a system,
I want to apply domain and URL pattern analysis WITHOUT making HTTP requests to eliminate 40-60% of candidates before scraping,
so that we reduce both scraping and LLM costs by eliminating unsuitable domains early.

- [ ] Each elimination logged with reasoning: "REJECT Layer 1 - Non-commercial TLD (.org)"
- [ ] URLs passing Layer 1 marked: "PASS Layer 1 - Proceeding to homepage scraping"
- [ ] Layer 1 analysis executes in <50ms per URL (no network calls)

### AC7: Database Integration
- [ ] Filter decisions stored with `elimination_layer: 'layer1'` field
- [ ] Layer 1 reasoning stored in `layer1_reasoning` field
- [ ] Database migration created for new fields
- [ ] Job-level counters: `jobs.layer1_eliminated_count`

### AC8: Cost Tracking

## Dev Notes

### Refactoring Overview

This story is being refactored from a generic "Pre-Filtering Engine" to "Layer 1 Domain Analysis" as part of the 3-tier progressive filtering architecture introduced in Sprint Change Proposal 2025-10-16.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Service Rename**: PreFilterService → Layer1DomainAnalysisService
2. **Focus Shift**: Generic blog/social/ecommerce filtering → Domain analysis for digital-native vs traditional companies
3. **Cost Impact**: Reduces LLM costs only → Reduces BOTH scraping AND LLM costs
4. **Database Fields**: prefilter_passed/prefilter_reasoning → elimination_layer/layer1_reasoning
5. **Performance Target**: <100ms → <50ms (stricter, but NO HTTP requests)

### Layer 1 Analysis Architecture

**Decision Flow:**
```
URL Input
    ↓
1. TLD Filtering
   - Check if TLD is non-commercial (.gov, .edu, .org) → REJECT
   - Check if TLD is personal blog (.me, .blog, .xyz) → REJECT
   - Commercial TLDs (.com, .io, .co, .ai) → CONTINUE
    ↓
2. Domain Classification
   - Extract domain keywords
   - Check for traditional business signals (restaurant, hotel, retail) → REJECT
   - Check for digital-native signals (software, saas, tech) → CONTINUE
    ↓
3. URL Pattern Exclusions
   - Check for subdomain blogs (blog.example.com) → REJECT
   - Check for tag/category pages (/tag/, /category/) → REJECT
   - Check for user-generated content (/user/, /profile/) → REJECT
    ↓
4. Target Profile Matching
   - Check for blog infrastructure indicators (insights, resources) → BOOST SCORE
   - Check for company type signals (platform, app) → BOOST SCORE
   - Check for negative signals (shop, store, buy) → REJECT
    ↓
FINAL RESULT: PASS or REJECT with layer1_reasoning
```

**Performance Optimization:**
- NO HTTP requests (domain analysis only)
- Pre-compiled regex patterns for URL pattern matching
- Early exit on first REJECT condition
- Target: <50ms per URL (vs <100ms in V1)

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Migration: Update results table for Layer 1 tracking
ALTER TABLE results
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS prefilter_passed,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS prefilter_reasoning,
  ADD COLUMN elimination_layer VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL, -- 'layer1' | 'layer2' | 'layer3' | null
  ADD COLUMN layer1_reasoning TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

-- Migration: Update jobs table for Layer 1 metrics
ALTER TABLE jobs
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS prefilter_rejected_count,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS prefilter_passed_count,
  ADD COLUMN layer1_eliminated_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Cost Savings Calculation:**
- Scraping cost per URL: ~$0.0001 (ScrapingBee homepage request)
- LLM cost per URL: ~$0.002 (Gemini 2.0 Flash classification)
- Layer 1 elimination target: 40-60% (400-600 URLs per 1000)
- Scraping savings: 500 × $0.0001 = $0.05
- LLM savings: 500 × $0.002 = $1.00
- Total savings per 1000 URLs: ~$1.05

### Configuration Structure

**layer1-domain-rules.json:**
```json
{
  "tld_filtering": {
    "commercial": [".com", ".io", ".co", ".ai", ".net", ".tech"],
    "non_commercial": [".gov", ".edu", ".org", ".mil"],
    "personal_blog": [".me", ".blog", ".xyz", ".wordpress.com", ".blogspot.com"]
  },
  "domain_classification": {
    "digital_native_keywords": [
      "software", "saas", "tech", "platform", "app", "cloud",
      "consulting", "marketing", "agency", "digital"
    ],
    "traditional_keywords": [
      "restaurant", "hotel", "shop", "store", "retail",
      "manufacturing", "construction", "plumbing"
    ]
  },
  "url_patterns": {
    "subdomain_blogs": ["^blog\\.", "^news\\.", "^insights\\."],
    "tag_pages": ["/tag/", "/category/", "/author/"],
    "user_content": ["/user/", "/profile/", "/member/"]
  },
  "target_profile": {
    "positive_indicators": ["insights", "resources", "learn", "platform", "app"],
    "negative_indicators": ["shop", "store", "buy", "cart", "checkout"]
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- TLD filtering: commercial, non-commercial, personal blog TLDs
- Domain classification: digital-native, traditional, neutral domains
- URL pattern exclusions: subdomain blogs, tag pages, user content
- Target profile matching: positive indicators, negative indicators
- Edge cases: URLs with multiple signals, borderline cases
- Performance: 100 URLs in <5 seconds (<50ms avg)

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Digital-Native B2B SaaS**: hubspot.com, mailchimp.com, intercom.com → PASS
2. **Traditional Businesses**: restaurant.com, hotel-chains.com, retail-store.com → REJECT
3. **Non-Commercial TLDs**: harvard.edu, nasa.gov, wikipedia.org → REJECT
4. **Personal Blogs**: john.me, myblog.blog, thoughts.xyz → REJECT
5. **Subdomain Blogs**: blog.company.com, news.startup.com → REJECT
6. **Tag Pages**: example.com/tag/marketing, site.com/category/tech → REJECT
7. **User Content**: platform.com/user/john, site.com/profile/123 → REJECT
8. **Target Profile PASS**: company.com/insights, platform.com/resources → PASS
9. **Negative Signals**: shop.example.com, buy-now.com → REJECT

**Elimination Rate Validation:**
- Test with 1000 URLs representing real-world distribution
- Expected elimination: 400-600 URLs (40-60%)
- Verify no HTTP requests made during analysis
- Verify performance <50ms per URL average
