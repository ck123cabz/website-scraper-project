# Story 2.1: NestJS Backend Foundation & Job Queue Setup

Status: Complete ✅ (All Tasks Completed, Deployed to Production, All ACs Verified)

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up NestJS backend with BullMQ queue integration,
so that we have production-grade architecture for job processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. NestJS application initialized with TypeScript
2. BullMQ configured with Redis connection (Railway managed Redis)
3. Job queue created: "url-processing-queue"
4. Bull Board dashboard configured for dev monitoring (at /admin/queues)
5. Supabase client configured with environment variables
6. Database tables created:
   - `jobs` (id, status, created_at, updated_at, url_count, processed_count, etc.)
   - `urls` (id, job_id, url, status, classification, cost, processing_time, etc.)
   - `logs` (id, job_id, timestamp, severity, message)
7. Health check endpoint: GET /health
8. Basic job endpoints: POST /jobs (create), GET /jobs/:id (status)
9. Deployed to Railway with auto-deployment on git push
10. Environment variables configured in Railway

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Framework & Architecture:**
- NestJS 10+ with TypeScript 5.5+ (production-grade Node.js framework)
- Monorepo structure: `apps/api/` for backend, `packages/shared/` for types
- Module-based architecture: Each feature as a NestJS module
- Dependency injection for all services
- Environment-based configuration (dotenv)

**Queue System Requirements:**
- BullMQ 5.0+ for job queue (Redis-based)
- Railway managed Redis (no local Redis setup)
- Queue name: "url-processing-queue"
- Bull Board for visual queue monitoring in development

**Database Integration:**
- Supabase PostgreSQL for persistence
- Supabase client with SERVICE_ROLE key (bypass RLS)
- Database migrations via Supabase CLI
- TypeScript types auto-generated from schema

**Deployment Target:**
- Platform: Railway (PaaS)
- Auto-deployment: Git push to main triggers deployment
- Environment variables: Set in Railway dashboard
- Build: `npm run build` in monorepo root
- Start: `npm run start:prod` for production

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Directories to Create:**

```
apps/api/
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts                     # NestJS bootstrap
│   ├── app.module.ts               # Root module
│   ├── health/
│   │   └── health.controller.ts    # Health check endpoint

│   ├── queue/
│   │   ├── queue.module.ts         # BullMQ configuration
│   │   └── queue.service.ts        # Queue operations
│   └── supabase/
│       ├── supabase.module.ts      # Supabase client module

├── package.json                     # Backend dependencies
├── tsconfig.json                    # TypeScript configuration
└── nest-cli.json                    # NestJS CLI configuration
```

**Supabase Migrations to Create:**

```
supabase/migrations/
├── YYYYMMDD_create_jobs_table.sql
├── YYYYMMDD_create_urls_table.sql
└── YYYYMMDD_create_activity_logs_table.sql
```

**Shared Types to Use:**

- `packages/shared/src/types/job.ts` - Job TypeScript type (from Story 1.1)
- `packages/shared/src/types/result.ts` - Result/URL type (from Story 1.6)
- `packages/shared/src/types/activity-log.ts` - ActivityLog type (from Story 1.4)
- `packages/shared/src/types/database.types.ts` - Supabase generated types

**Environment Variables Required:**

```
# Railway Environment Variables
REDIS_URL=redis://...                  # Railway managed Redis
SUPABASE_URL=https://...supabase.co    # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...            # Service role key (bypass RLS)
PORT=3001                              # API port (Railway assigns)
NODE_ENV=production                    # Environment mode
```

### Testing Standards Summary

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual API testing via curl/Postman for endpoints
- Visual verification of Bull Board dashboard
- Supabase MCP for database verification
- Railway deployment verification via health check
- Unit tests deferred for MVP velocity (focus on integration)

**Test Coverage for Story 2.1:**
- Health check endpoint responds with 200 OK
- POST /jobs creates record in Supabase jobs table
- GET /jobs/:id returns job data from database
- Bull Board dashboard accessible at /admin/queues
- Redis connection successful (queue operations work)
- Railway deployment accessible via public URL

**Test Data:**
- Mock job creation: `{ name: "Test Job", totalUrls: 100 }`
- Expected job record with generated ID, timestamps, status="pending"

**MCP Testing Workflow:**
1. Deploy backend to Railway
2. curl -X GET https://api-url/health - verify 200 OK response
3. curl -X POST https://api-url/jobs -d '{"name":"Test Job","totalUrls":100}'
4. Supabase MCP: `SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE name = 'Test Job'` - verify record exists
5. Open https://api-url/admin/queues - verify Bull Board dashboard loads
6. Document API endpoints and response formats

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Monorepo: Turborepo with apps/ and packages/
- Backend in apps/api/ (separate from apps/web/ frontend)
- Shared types in packages/shared/src/types/
- Database schema migrations in supabase/migrations/
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Story 2.1 is foundation story - no dependencies on other Epic 2 stories
- Frontend (Epic 1) already has API client ready for integration
- Shared types already defined in Stories 1.1-1.6
- Supabase project already configured (used by frontend)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Modules: PascalCase with .module.ts suffix (JobsModule)
- Controllers: PascalCase with .controller.ts suffix (JobsController)
- Services: PascalCase with .service.ts suffix (JobsService)
- Files: kebab-case (jobs.module.ts, jobs.controller.ts)

**Integration Points:**
- Frontend API client (apps/web/lib/api-client.ts) will call backend endpoints
- Supabase Realtime (Story 1.1) will receive database updates from backend
- Bull Board accessible at /admin/queues for development monitoring

**Epic 2 Foundation:**
- Story 2.1 provides infrastructure for Stories 2.2-2.5
- Story 2.2 (URL Upload) will use POST /jobs endpoint
- Story 2.5 (Worker) will consume from url-processing-queue
- All Epic 2 stories depend on database schema created here

**Database Schema:**
- Frontend types already defined in packages/shared/src/types/
