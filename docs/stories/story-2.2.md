# Story 2.2: Bulk URL Upload & Job Creation

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a team member,
I want to upload URLs via file or textarea and create scraping job,
so that I can start processing my URL list.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. POST /jobs/create endpoint accepts:
   - File upload (CSV, TXT) via multipart/form-data
   - JSON body with `urls` array
   - Text body with line-separated URLs
2. CSV parser handles: single column, multi-column (auto-detect URL column), headers/no headers
3. URL validation: basic format check, remove empty lines, trim whitespace
4. Deduplication: remove duplicate URLs within job
5. Job record created in database with status "pending"
6. URLs bulk inserted into database linked to job
7. Response returns: job_id, url_count, duplicates_removed_count
8. Large uploads (10K+ URLs) processed efficiently (<5 seconds)
9. Error handling: invalid file format, no URLs found, file too large (>10MB)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Endpoint Design:**
- RESTful endpoint: POST /jobs/create
- Supports multiple content types: multipart/form-data, application/json, text/plain
- Content-Type detection via NestJS @UploadedFile() and @Body() decorators
- Proper HTTP status codes: 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 413 Payload Too Large, 500 Internal Server Error

**File Parsing Requirements:**
- CSV: Use papaparse library for robust CSV parsing with header detection
- TXT: Simple line-by-line parsing with whitespace trimming
- Auto-detect URL column in multi-column CSV (heuristic matching or first column with valid URLs)
- Handle edge cases: empty lines, whitespace-only lines, non-URL data

**URL Processing Pipeline:**
1. Parse file/body → Extract raw URLs
2. Validate URLs → Filter invalid URLs
3. Normalize URLs → Consistent format (trim, lowercase domain, remove trailing slash)
4. Deduplicate → Remove duplicates within job
5. Bulk insert → Database transaction (job + URLs)

**Database Constraints:**
- Use database transaction for atomicity (job + URLs inserted together or rolled back)
- Bulk insert optimization: Batch URLs into chunks of 1000 for Supabase insert
- Foreign key: results.job_id references jobs.id (already exists from Story 2.1)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Target: <5 seconds for 10K URLs (file upload → database insertion complete)
- Streaming: Avoid loading entire file into memory (use Node.js streams for large files)
- Batch inserts: 1000 URLs per Supabase insert operation

**Validation and Error Handling:**
- Input validation: Use class-validator decorators in DTOs
- File size limit: 10MB enforced by multer configuration
- File type validation: Only .csv and .txt allowed
- Graceful error messages: Return user-friendly error messages without exposing internals

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files to Create:**

```
apps/api/src/jobs/
├── services/
│   ├── file-parser.service.ts       # CSV/TXT parsing logic
│   └── url-validation.service.ts    # URL validation and normalization
├── dto/
│   ├── create-job.dto.ts            # Request DTO for job creation
│   └── create-job-response.dto.ts   # Response DTO
└── __tests__/
    ├── file-parser.service.spec.ts  # Unit tests for parsing
    └── url-validation.service.spec.ts # Unit tests for validation
```

**Files to Modify:**

```
apps/api/src/jobs/
├── jobs.controller.ts               # Add POST /jobs/create endpoint with file upload
├── jobs.service.ts                  # Add createJobWithUrls() method with transaction
└── jobs.module.ts                   # Import MulterModule, register new services

apps/api/src/queue/queue.service.ts  # Add error event listener (Story 2.1 follow-up)
apps/api/package.json                 # Add dependencies: multer, papaparse, class-validator
```

**Dependencies to Install:**

```json
{
  "@nestjs/platform-express": "^10.3.0",  // Already installed in 2.1
  "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",                // File upload handling
  "papaparse": "^5.4.1",                   // CSV parsing
  "@types/multer": "^1.4.11",              // TypeScript types for multer
  "@types/papaparse": "^5.3.14",           // TypeScript types for papaparse
  "class-validator": "^0.14.1",            // Validation decorators
  "class-transformer": "^0.5.1"            // DTO transformation
}
```

**Environment Variables Required:**
- No new environment variables for Story 2.2
- Existing: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, REDIS_URL (from Story 2.1)

### Testing Standards Summary

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests: FileParserService, UrlValidationService (Jest + mocks)
- Integration tests: Full endpoint testing with real file uploads (Postman/curl)
- Database tests: Supabase MCP to verify job and URL records
- Performance tests: 10K URLs upload time measurement

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- CSV parsing: single column, multi-column, headers/no headers, empty file
- TXT parsing: line-separated, whitespace handling, empty lines
- URL validation: valid URLs, invalid URLs (no protocol, invalid domain), empty strings
- URL normalization: trailing slash removal, case normalization, protocol normalization
- Deduplication: exact duplicates, normalized duplicates (http vs https)

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Happy Path**: Upload CSV with 1000 URLs → Verify job created with 1000 URLs in database
2. **Deduplication**: Upload file with 100 unique URLs + 20 duplicates → Verify response shows duplicates_removed: 20
3. **Large Upload**: Upload TXT with 10K URLs → Verify <5s completion, all URLs in database
4. **Invalid Format**: Upload .xlsx file → Verify 400 Bad Request with error message
5. **No URLs**: Upload empty CSV → Verify 400 with "No valid URLs found"
6. **File Too Large**: Upload 11MB file → Verify 413 Payload Too Large
7. **Multi-column CSV**: Upload CSV with 3 columns (name, url, category) → Verify URLs extracted correctly
8. **JSON Body**: POST with JSON body `{ "urls": ["url1", "url2"] }` → Verify job created

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- 1K URLs: <1 second
- 5K URLs: <3 seconds
- 10K URLs: <5 seconds (target met)

**MCP Testing Workflow:**
1. Upload file via curl/Postman to POST /jobs/create
2. Supabase MCP: SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE id = '<job_id>' → Verify job record with correct totalUrls
3. Supabase MCP: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results WHERE job_id = '<job_id>' → Verify URL count matches
4. Measure time: Start upload → Receive response → Verify <5s for 10K URLs

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- NestJS backend at apps/api/ (monorepo structure maintained)
- Shared types in packages/shared/src/types/ (Job, Result types already defined in Story 2.1)
- Database schema in Supabase (jobs, results tables exist from Story 2.1)
- File organization: Feature-based modules (JobsModule with services subfolder)

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Story 2.2 extends Story 2.1 infrastructure (no breaking changes)
- Database schema unchanged (uses existing jobs and results tables)
- API versioning not required (new endpoint added to JobsController)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Services: PascalCase with .service.ts suffix (FileParserService, UrlValidationService)
- DTOs: PascalCase with .dto.ts suffix (CreateJobDto, CreateJobResponseDto)
- Files: kebab-case (file-parser.service.ts, create-job.dto.ts)
- Test files: .spec.ts suffix (file-parser.service.spec.ts)

**Integration Points:**
- Frontend (Story 1.1-1.7): POST /jobs/create endpoint will be called from frontend job creation form
- Database (Story 2.1): Uses jobs and results tables created in Story 2.1
- Queue (Story 2.5): Job creation will eventually trigger queue processing (deferred to Story 2.5)

**Story 2.1 Carry-Overs:**
- BullMQ error listener: Added as Task 9 in this story (M1 from Story 2.1 review)
- Input validation: Implementing class-validator in this story (noted in Story 2.1 review)
- Health check enhancement: Deferred to future story (not blocking)
- Structured logging (Pino): Deferred to Story 2.3+ (console.log acceptable for MVP)
