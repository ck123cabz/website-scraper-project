## Dev Notes

### Railway Architecture

**Services:**
- **API Service:** NestJS backend (Node.js 20+)
- **Frontend Service:** Next.js app (Node.js 20+)
- **Redis Service:** Railway-managed Redis (no configuration needed)

**Networking:**
- API and Frontend services get public Railway domains
- Redis accessible only within Railway private network
- CORS configured to allow Frontend → API communication

**Build Process:**
- Railway uses Nixpacks for automatic build detection
- Monorepo structure requires proper workspace configuration
- Build happens in `/app` directory on Railway
- Environment variables available during build and runtime

### Environment Variables Best Practices

**Required for API:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: Supabase PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Railway Redis connection string
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public API key (Frontend + API)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Service role key (API only - has admin access)
- `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY`: ScrapingBee production credits
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google AI Studio API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API key
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Frontend service URL (for CORS)
- `USE_MOCK_SERVICES=false`: Disable mock services

**Required for Frontend:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: API service URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public API key

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit secrets to git
- Use Railway's environment variable UI (encrypted at rest)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use service role key only in backend (never expose to frontend)

### Database Migrations

**Migration Strategy:**
- All migrations in `supabase/migrations/` directory
- Apply migrations using Supabase CLI: `npx supabase db push`
- Verify migrations in Supabase Dashboard
- Migrations are idempotent (can be re-run safely)

**Migration Files (Story 3.1 created these):**
- `20251016030000_add_layer3_confidence_thresholds.sql`
- `20251016050000_refactor_settings_for_3tier.sql`
- `20251017000000_fix_settings_bugs.sql`

### Graceful Shutdown

**Why It Matters:**
Railway sends SIGTERM signal 10 seconds before killing the process during deployments. Without graceful shutdown handling, jobs could be interrupted mid-processing, causing data corruption or incomplete results.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, closing server gracefully...');

  // 1. Stop accepting new HTTP requests
  await app.close();

  // 2. Wait for BullMQ workers to finish current jobs
  await bullQueue.close();

  // 3. Close database connections
  await prisma.$disconnect();

  // 4. Close Redis connection
  await redis.quit();

  console.log('Server closed gracefully');
  process.exit(0);
});
```

### Common Deployment Issues

**Issue 1: Build Fails with "Cannot find module"**
- **Cause:** Monorepo dependencies not resolved
- **Solution:** Verify `package.json` workspaces field, run `npm ci` locally to test

**Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Found**
- **Cause:** Railway env vars not configured or typo in variable name
- **Solution:** Double-check Railway Dashboard → Service → Variables

**Issue 3: CORS Errors in Browser**
- **Cause:** CORS origin doesn't match Frontend URL
- **Solution:** Verify `FRONTEND_URL` env var matches actual Railway domain

**Issue 4: Database Connection Timeout**
- **Cause:** Supabase project paused or connection string incorrect
- **Solution:** Verify Supabase project active, test connection locally with psql

**Issue 5: Redis Connection Failed**
- **Cause:** REDIS_URL not configured or Redis service not running
- **Solution:** Verify Redis service running in Railway, copy correct REDIS_URL

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Deployment Details

**Production URLs:**
- API: https://api-production-beab.up.railway.app
- Frontend: https://web-production-db484.up.railway.app
- Railway Project ID: 6c5c7374-8429-4498-96fa-3c0318391636

**Health Check Status (Verified):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "redis": "connected",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

**Services Deployed:**
1. Redis (Railway managed) - TCP proxy connection
2. API (NestJS, Node.js 20) - Successfully deployed
3. Web (Next.js) - Configuration in progress

### Debug Log References

**Deployment Session:** 2025-10-16 (Story 3.2 execution)
- Initial deployment failed: npm package error in nixpacks.toml
- Fix applied: Removed invalid "npm" from nixPkgs (Node.js 20 includes npm)
- Redis connection issue: Switched from private network to public TCP proxy URL
- Final deployment: SUCCESS ✅

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Highlights:**
1. Enhanced health endpoint with database/Redis connection checks (apps/api/src/health/health.controller.ts:1)
2. Implemented explicit SIGTERM handler for graceful shutdown (apps/api/src/main.ts:54)
3. Improved CORS configuration for production domains (apps/api/src/main.ts:61)
4. Updated nixpacks.toml to Node.js 20 with simplified build (nixpacks.toml:1)
5. Configured all environment variables via Railway MCP tools
6. Successfully deployed API with full health check passing

**Challenges Resolved:**
- Railway private networking (`redis.railway.internal`) not resolving → Used public TCP proxy URL
- nixpacks build failure → Removed invalid npm package reference
- Monorepo build configuration → Used existing railway.toml with API-specific commands

### File List

**Modified Files:**
- `nixpacks.toml` - Updated to Node.js 20, removed invalid npm package
- `apps/api/src/main.ts` - Added SIGTERM handler, improved CORS for production
- `apps/api/src/health/health.controller.ts` - Enhanced with DB/Redis connection checks

**Configuration:**
- Railway services: 3 services created (Redis, api, web)
- Environment variables: 11 variables configured for API service
- Domains generated: api-production-beab.up.railway.app, web-production-db484.up.railway.app
