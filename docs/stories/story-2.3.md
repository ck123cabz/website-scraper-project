# Story 2.3: Intelligent Pre-Filtering Engine

Status: Complete (Security Hardened)

## Story

As a system,
I want to filter URLs before sending to LLM using regex patterns,
so that we reduce LLM API costs by 40-60%.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pre-filter service with configurable regex rules
2. Default rules filter out:
   - Known blog platforms: `wordpress.com/*/`, `blogspot.com`, `medium.com/@*`, `substack.com`
   - Social media: `facebook.com`, `twitter.com`, `linkedin.com/in/`
   - E-commerce: `amazon.com`, `ebay.com`, `shopify.com`
   - Forums: `reddit.com`, `quora.com`
   - Large aggregators: `wikipedia.org`, `youtube.com`
3. Each rule has reasoning logged: "REJECT - Blog platform domain"
4. URLs passing pre-filter marked: "PASS - Sending to LLM"
5. Pre-filtering executes in <100ms per URL
6. Filter decisions logged to database
7. Configuration endpoint to update rules (admin only - can be file-based for MVP)
8. Metrics tracked: pre-filter pass rate, estimated cost savings

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Service Design:**
- PreFilterService as injectable NestJS service
- Rule-based filtering with configurable regex patterns
- Early exit optimization: stop on first matching rule
- Stateless service: all rules loaded at initialization, no per-request state

**Rule Configuration Format:**
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "category": "blog_platform",
      "pattern": "wordpress\\.com/",
      "reasoning": "REJECT - Blog platform domain (WordPress.com)"
    },
    {
      "category": "social_media",
      "pattern": "facebook\\.com",
      "reasoning": "REJECT - Social media platform"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pre-Filter Decision Flow:**
1. URL received → PreFilterService.filterUrl(url)
2. Iterate through compiled RegExp rules
3. First match → Return { passed: false, reasoning: rule.reasoning, matched_rule: rule.category }
4. No match → Return { passed: true, reasoning: "PASS - Sending to LLM" }
5. Log decision to activity_logs
6. Store result in results.prefilter_passed and results.prefilter_reasoning

**Performance Requirements:**
- <100ms per URL (AC5)
- Achieved by pre-compiling RegExp at service init
- Early exit on first match (no unnecessary pattern testing)
- No database queries in hot path (all rules in-memory)

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Migration: Add pre-filter columns to results table
ALTER TABLE results
  ADD COLUMN prefilter_passed BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL,
  ADD COLUMN prefilter_reasoning TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

-- Migration: Add pre-filter metrics to jobs table
ALTER TABLE jobs
  ADD COLUMN prefilter_rejected_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN prefilter_passed_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Cost Savings Calculation:**
- Avg Gemini 2.0 Flash cost: ~$0.00045 per URL (estimate from PRD)
- Avg GPT-4o-mini cost: ~$0.0007 per URL
- Cost savings = prefilter_rejected_count × $0.00045
- Target: 40-60% rejection rate (from PRD Goal 2)
- Expected savings: 4,000-6,000 URLs rejected per 10K batch = $1.80-$2.70 saved per batch

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files to Create:**

```
apps/api/src/jobs/
├── services/
│   └── prefilter.service.ts             # Pre-filter logic with rule engine
├── config/
│   └── default-filter-rules.json        # Default filter rule definitions
└── __tests__/
    └── prefilter.service.spec.ts        # Unit tests for pre-filter service

apps/api/src/types/
└── prefilter.types.ts                    # PreFilterRule, PreFilterResult interfaces
```

**Files to Modify:**

```
apps/api/src/jobs/
├── jobs.service.ts                       # Store pre-filter results, update metrics
├── jobs.module.ts                        # Register PreFilterService

└── [timestamp]_add_prefilter_columns.sql  # Database migration for new columns

apps/api/package.json                      # No new dependencies required
```

**Dependencies:**
- No new NPM dependencies required
- Uses built-in JavaScript RegExp
- JSON config loaded via fs.readFileSync (Node.js built-in)

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- PreFilterService.filterUrl() with all rule categories (blog, social, ecommerce, forum, aggregator)
- Edge cases: URLs with query params, trailing slashes, mixed case
- Performance test: 100 URLs in <10 seconds
- Invalid rule handling: malformed regex patterns in config

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Happy Path**: Upload 100 URLs (50 filterable, 50 passable) → Verify 50 rejected, 50 passed
2. **Blog Platform Rules**: Upload wordpress.com, blogspot.com, medium.com/@author URLs → All rejected
3. **Social Media Rules**: Upload facebook.com, twitter.com, linkedin.com/in/ URLs → All rejected
4. **Passable URLs**: Upload company blogs, news sites, personal websites → All pass
5. **Database Logging**: Verify pre-filter results stored in results.prefilter_passed, results.prefilter_reasoning
6. **Activity Logs**: Verify log entries for pre-filter decisions (severity: 'info')
7. **Metrics Tracking**: Verify job.prefilter_rejected_count and job.prefilter_passed_count
8. **Performance**: Process 1000 URLs, verify avg time <100ms per URL

**Cost Savings Verification:**
- Test with 10K URLs, expected 40-60% rejection rate (4K-6K rejected)
- Calculate cost savings: rejected_count × $0.00045 = $1.80-$2.70 saved
- Display savings in dashboard (Story 1.5 integration point)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Feature-based NestJS modules (PreFilterService under JobsModule)
- Configuration in apps/api/src/config/ directory (follows NestJS conventions)
- Shared types in packages/shared/src/types/ (PreFilterRule, PreFilterResult)
- Database migrations in supabase/migrations/

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Story 2.3 extends Story 2.1 (database schema) and Story 2.2 (job creation)
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Pre-filter service is injectable, no tight coupling to other services

**Integration Points:**
- JobsService: Store pre-filter results during job creation (Story 2.2 integration)
- Worker (Story 2.5): Call PreFilterService before LLM classification
- Dashboard (Story 1.5): Display cost savings metrics from pre-filter rejection rate
- Activity Logs (Story 1.4): Show pre-filter decisions in live log feed

**Story 2.2 Carry-Overs:**
- Pre-filter runs during worker processing (Story 2.5), not at job creation
- For now, pre-filter logic can be tested standalone with unit/integration tests
- Worker integration deferred to Story 2.5

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** CK
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Story 2.3 delivers a well-architected, performant pre-filtering service that meets all core acceptance criteria for the standalone implementation phase. The code demonstrates solid NestJS patterns, excellent test coverage (38 passing tests), and exceptional performance (<1ms vs <100ms requirement). The implementation is production-ready for its current scope, with well-documented deferred work for Story 2.5 worker integration.

However, **5 High-severity and 8 Medium-severity findings** require attention before full production deployment, primarily focused on security hardening (ReDoS vulnerability, path traversal risk), error handling robustness, and integration completeness.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **[H1] Path Traversal Risk in Config Loading** (prefilter.service.ts:34)
   - `readFileSync(join(__dirname, '../../config/default-filter-rules.json'))` uses relative path
   - Risk: In production builds, `__dirname` may resolve incorrectly
   - Impact: Service fails silently, all URLs pass through (fail-open), defeating cost optimization goal

2. **[H2] Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability** (default-filter-rules.json)
   - No validation of regex complexity or catastrophic backtracking patterns
   - Pattern `wordpress\\.com/.*` with malicious input could cause CPU exhaustion
   - Impact: Service degradation or DoS attack vector

3. **[H3] Missing Database Migration File** (supabase/migrations/)
   - Migration `add_prefilter_columns` listed in database but file not found in repository
   - Impact: Cannot reproduce schema in new environments, deployment failures

4. **[H4] Incomplete Integration with JobsService** (AC6 partial)
   - Pre-filter results not persisted to database in job creation flow
   - Tasks 5.3, 7.3-7.6 deferred but no API contracts defined
   - Impact: Story 2.5 integration will require rework, metrics unavailable

5. **[H5] No Input Validation on filterUrl()** (prefilter.service.ts:67)
   - Accepts `null`, `undefined`, empty strings without type validation
   - Fail-open on error is correct but logging reveals potential injection risk
   - Impact: Security logs could be polluted, monitoring blind spots

#### Medium Severity

1. **[M1] Synchronous File I/O in Constructor** (prefilter.service.ts:32-58)
   - `readFileSync()` blocks event loop during service initialization
   - Anti-pattern in async Node.js environment
   - Impact: Application startup delays, especially on slow file systems

2. **[M2] Case-Insensitive Matching May Over-Match** (prefilter.service.ts:41)
   - All patterns compiled with `/i` flag globally
   - `facebook.com` matches `FaceBook.com` (intended) but also `myfacebook.company.com` (unintended?)
   - Impact: False positives in rejection, legitimate URLs filtered

3. **[M3] No Metrics Instrumentation** (AC8 incomplete)
   - Service logs but doesn't expose metrics (counters, histograms)
   - No Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration for monitoring
   - Impact: Cannot verify 40-60% cost savings in production

4. **[M4] Missing Configuration Reload Mechanism** (AC7 partial)
   - Rules loaded once at startup, no hot-reload capability
   - Requires service restart to update filter rules
   - Impact: Deployment downtime for rule updates

5. **[M5] Test Coverage Gaps for Integration Paths** (Tasks 10.1-10.6 deferred)
   - No tests for JobsService integration, database writes, activity logs
   - Worker pipeline integration completely untested
   - Impact: Story 2.5 will discover integration bugs late

6. **[M6] Overly Broad Fail-Open Strategy** (prefilter.service.ts:106-113)
   - All errors default to PASS, including unexpected exceptions
   - Could mask serious issues (corrupted config, memory errors)
   - Impact: Silent failures, cost optimization bypassed

7. **[M7] Regex Patterns Too Permissive** (default-filter-rules.json:5, 10)
   - `wordpress\\.com/.*` rejects ALL wordpress.com URLs, including WooCommerce stores (business sites)
   - `blogspot\\.com` rejects all blogspot, including technical blogs
   - Impact: May exceed 60% rejection rate, filter legitimate targets

8. **[M8] No Rate Limit Protection on filterUrl()** (performance consideration)
   - Method is synchronous but no backpressure mechanism
   - Bulk operations (10K URLs) could saturate CPU with regex matching
   - Impact: Service degradation under high load

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AC1: Configurable regex rules | ✅ PASS | JSON config loaded, 16 rules defined |
| AC2: Default rules (5 categories) | ✅ PASS | All categories implemented |
| AC3: Reasoning logged | ✅ PASS | Each rule has reasoning string |
| AC4: Pass-through marked | ✅ PASS | Exact string returned |
| AC5: <100ms per URL | ✅ PASS | Achieved <1ms avg (100x faster) |
| AC6: Decisions logged to database | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Schema ready, persistence deferred to 2.5 |
| AC7: Configuration endpoint | ⚠️ PARTIAL | File-based works, no reload/admin endpoint |
| AC8: Metrics tracked | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Schema ready, runtime tracking deferred to 2.5 |

**Overall: 5/8 Complete, 3/8 Partial** (Story scope appropriately deferred to 2.5 for integration)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test suite (38 tests, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ All 5 rule categories tested with real-world URLs
- ✅ Edge cases covered (query params, trailing slashes, case-insensitive, subdomains)
- ✅ Performance tests validate <100ms requirement
- ✅ Error handling tests (null, undefined, malformed URLs)

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No integration tests with JobsService or database
- ❌ No tests for Supabase migration application
- ❌ No tests for config reload scenarios
- ❌ No ReDoS attack vector tests (malicious regex patterns)
- ❌ No concurrency/race condition tests
- ❌ No tests for Story 2.5 worker integration contracts

**Test Coverage Estimate: ~85% for in-scope code, 0% for deferred integration points**

### Architectural Alignment

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ NestJS Best Practices: Proper use of `@Injectable()`, constructor injection, Logger
2. ✅ Separation of Concerns: Service is stateless, pure business logic, no database coupling
3. ✅ Type Safety: Full TypeScript types in shared package, exported correctly
4. ✅ Performance Optimization: Regex compiled at init, early exit on first match, no hot path I/O
5. ✅ Fail-Open Strategy: Errors default to PASS (safe degradation, no blocking)
6. ✅ Module Organization: Follows NestJS module structure, properly exported in JobsModule

**Concerns:**
1. ⚠️ Synchronous I/O: `readFileSync()` in constructor violates async-first Node.js principles
2. ⚠️ Path Resolution: Relative path `../../config/` fragile across deployment environments
3. ⚠️ Static Configuration: No dynamic config updates without restart
4. ⚠️ Missing Observability: No metrics, tracing, or performance instrumentation hooks

### Security Notes

**Findings:**
1. **[Critical]** ReDoS vulnerability: No regex complexity validation or execution timeout
2. **[High]** Path traversal potential: Relative file paths in production build
3. **[Medium]** Log injection: Unvalidated URLs logged, could inject ANSI codes or control characters
4. **[Low]** Error message exposure: Stack traces logged, may leak internal paths

**Mitigations Applied:**
- ✅ No user input directly in regex patterns (patterns are static config)
- ✅ Fail-open on error prevents DoS from blocking legitimate requests
- ✅ No SQL/command injection risk (no dynamic queries, no shell execution)

**Recommendations:**
- Validate regex patterns for complexity (set max quantifier depth)
- Use absolute paths resolved from `process.cwd()` or environment variables
- Sanitize URLs before logging (remove ANSI codes, limit length)
- Add regex execution timeout (e.g., 10ms per pattern test)

### Best-Practices and References

**NestJS Patterns Applied:**
- ✅ Injectable service with `@Injectable()` decorator
- ✅ Constructor-based dependency injection
- ✅ Stateless service design (thread-safe for concurrent requests)
- ✅ Logger integration with contextual class name

**Recommended Improvements:**
1. **Async Config Loading**: Use NestJS `ConfigModule` with async providers
   - Reference: https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#async-configuration
2. **Health Indicator**: Implement `HealthIndicator` to expose rule count, load status
   - Reference: https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus#custom-health-indicator
3. **Metrics with Prometheus**: Use `@nestjs/terminus` + `prom-client` for metrics
   - Reference: https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus#prometheus-metrics
4. **Request Scoped Caching**: Cache filter results per request for duplicate URLs
   - Reference: https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching

**Performance Best Practices Followed:**
- ✅ Pre-compiled regex patterns (not recompiled per request)
- ✅ Early exit on first match (O(n) worst case, O(1) best case)
- ✅ No database queries in hot path
- ✅ Stateless design (no memory leaks from per-request state)

### Action Items

**Before Story 2.5 Integration (Prioritized):**

1. **[AI-Review][High]** Add ReDoS protection: Validate regex complexity, add execution timeout (AC3, AC5)
   - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:32-58
   - Suggested: Use `safe-regex` npm package, limit quantifier depth to 10

2. **[AI-Review][High]** Fix config path resolution: Use absolute path or NestJS ConfigService
   - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:34
   - Suggested: `process.env.CONFIG_PATH || join(process.cwd(), 'config/default-filter-rules.json')`

3. **[AI-Review][High]** Add database migration file to repository (AC6)
   - Location: supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_prefilter_columns.sql
   - Suggested: Extract from Supabase and commit to repo

4. **[AI-Review][High]** Implement JobsService integration for persistence (AC6, Tasks 5.3-5.4)
   - Files: apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.service.ts:createJobWithUrls()
   - Suggested: Call `preFilterService.filterUrl()`, store results with URL batch

5. **[AI-Review][High]** Add input validation to filterUrl() (Security)
   - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:67
   - Suggested: Add Zod schema or class-validator for URL string validation

6. **[AI-Review][Med]** Convert to async config loading with NestJS ConfigModule
   - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:32-58
   - Suggested: Use `@nestjs/config` with async factory provider

7. **[AI-Review][Med]** Refine regex patterns to reduce false positives (AC2)
   - File: apps/api/src/config/default-filter-rules.json:5, 10
   - Suggested: Change `wordpress\\.com/.*` to `wordpress\\.com/[^/]+/[0-9]{4}/` (blog posts only)

8. **[AI-Review][Med]** Add metrics instrumentation (AC8, Tasks 7.3-7.6)
   - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:67-114
   - Suggested: Inject `@nestjs/terminus` Counter for rejections/passes

9. **[AI-Review][Med]** Implement integration tests with JobsService (Task 10.1-10.6)
   - Location: apps/api/src/jobs/__tests__/jobs-prefilter.integration.spec.ts
   - Suggested: Test full flow: upload → filter → store → query results

10. **[AI-Review][Med]** Add configuration reload mechanism (AC7)
    - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts
    - Suggested: Add `reloadRules()` method, expose via admin endpoint

11. **[AI-Review][Low]** Strengthen fail-open strategy with error classification
    - File: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:106-113
    - Suggested: Fail-hard on config errors, fail-open only on runtime errors

12. **[AI-Review][Low]** Sanitize URLs before logging (Security)
    - Files: apps/api/src/jobs/services/prefilter.service.ts:79, 97
    - Suggested: Truncate URLs to 200 chars, strip ANSI codes

13. **[AI-Review][Low]** Add TypeScript strict mode enforcement
    - File: apps/api/tsconfig.json
    - Suggested: Enable `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`

**Review Complete** - Excellent foundation, address High-severity items before Story 2.5 integration.
