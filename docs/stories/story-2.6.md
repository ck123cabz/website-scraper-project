# Story 2.6: Layer 2 Operational Filter (Homepage Scraping & Company Validation)

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a system,
I want to validate company infrastructure and active blog through homepage scraping,
so that we eliminate non-viable candidates before expensive LLM classification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Homepage-Only Scraping
- [x] Scrape homepage only (not full site) to optimize ScrapingBee usage
- [x] Extract company infrastructure signals: About page, Team page, Contact page presence
- [x] Process only Layer 1 survivors (URLs that passed domain analysis)

### AC2: Company Infrastructure Detection
- [x] Detect presence of: About page, Team page, Contact page (minimum 2 of 3 required)
- [x] Store detection results in `layer2_signals` JSONB field
- [x] Log detected pages: "Found: About, Team (2/3 required pages)"

### AC3: Active Blog Validation
- [x] Detect blog section existence on homepage
- [x] Check recent post publish dates (within configurable threshold, default 90 days)
- [x] Minimum requirement: 1 post within threshold to pass
- [x] Store blog freshness in `layer2_signals.blog_last_post_date`

### AC4: Tech Stack Detection
- [x] Identify analytics tools (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- [x] Identify marketing platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, ActiveCampaign, etc.)
- [x] Score based on professional tool presence (2+ tools = PASS)
- [x] Store detected tools in `layer2_signals.tech_stack` array

### AC5: Professional Design Indicators
- [x] Modern CSS framework detection (Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI)
- [x] Responsive design check (viewport meta tag, media queries)
- [x] Professional imagery assessment (stock photos, custom graphics)
- [x] Store design score in `layer2_signals.design_quality` (1-10)

### AC6: Configuration Integration
- [x] Load Layer 2 rules from Story 3.0 settings (`classification_settings.layer2_rules`)
- [x] Configurable thresholds: blog_freshness_days, required_pages_count, min_tech_stack_tools
- [x] Configurable pass/fail criteria per signal type

### AC7: Performance Target
- [x] 70% pass rate of Layer 1 survivors (target: eliminate 30%)
- [x] Processing time: <5 seconds per URL (including ScrapingBee request)
- [x] Parallel processing: 5 concurrent URLs (respects ScrapingBee rate limits)

### AC8: Results Tracking
- [x] Store `layer2_signals` (JSONB) with all detected signals
- [x] Mark elimination: `elimination_layer = 'layer2'` if rejected
- [x] Update job counters: `jobs.layer2_eliminated_count`
- [x] Log Layer 2 decision reasoning: "REJECT Layer 2 - Missing required pages (1/3 found)"

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Service Design:**
- Layer2OperationalFilterService as injectable NestJS service
- Homepage-only scraping to minimize ScrapingBee costs
- Signal-based filtering: company pages, blog freshness, tech stack, design quality
- Configurable thresholds loaded from Story 3.0 settings
- Stateless service: all configuration loaded at initialization

**Layer 2 Signals Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Layer2Signals {
  company_pages: {
    has_about: boolean;
    has_team: boolean;
    has_contact: boolean;
    count: number; // Must be >= 2
  };
  blog_data: {
    has_blog: boolean;
    last_post_date: string | null; // ISO date
    days_since_last_post: number | null;
    passes_freshness: boolean;
  };
  tech_stack: {
    tools_detected: string[]; // ['Google Analytics', 'HubSpot']
    count: number; // Must be >= 2
  };
  design_quality: {
    score: number; // 1-10
    has_modern_framework: boolean;
    is_responsive: boolean;
    has_professional_imagery: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Layer 2 Decision Flow:**
1. URL passes Layer 1 → Layer2OperationalFilterService.filterUrl(url)
2. Scrape homepage HTML via ScrapingBee (single-page request)
3. Parse HTML for all signals:
   - Company pages (About, Team, Contact)
   - Blog section and post dates
   - Tech stack tools (analytics, marketing)
   - Design quality indicators
4. Evaluate pass/fail:
   - company_pages.count >= 2 AND
   - blog_data.passes_freshness = true AND
   - tech_stack.count >= 2 AND
   - design_quality.score >= 6
5. If any criterion fails → Return { passed: false, reasoning: "...", signals }
6. If all pass → Return { passed: true, reasoning: "PASS Layer 2", signals }
7. Store signals in results.layer2_signals
8. If rejected: Update elimination_layer = 'layer2', increment job.layer2_eliminated_count

**Performance Requirements:**
- <5 seconds per URL (AC7)
- Achieved by:
  - Homepage-only scraping (not full site)
  - Efficient HTML parsing (Cheerio)
  - Caching homepage HTML (24-hour TTL)
  - Concurrent processing (5 URLs)

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Migration: Add Layer 2 fields to results table
ALTER TABLE results
  ADD COLUMN layer2_signals JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

-- Migration: Add Layer 2 metrics to jobs table
ALTER TABLE jobs
  ADD COLUMN layer2_eliminated_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Index for JSONB queries (optional optimization)
CREATE INDEX idx_results_layer2_signals ON results USING GIN (layer2_signals);
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- Layer 2 scrapes homepage ONLY (not full site)
- ScrapingBee cost per homepage: ~$0.0001/request
- Eliminates 30% of Layer 1 survivors → saves 30% Layer 3 LLM costs
- Example: 500 Layer 1 survivors → Eliminate 150 at Layer 2 → Save 150 × $0.002 = $0.30 LLM cost
- Total Layer 2 cost: 500 × $0.0001 = $0.05 → Net savings: $0.25 per 500 URLs

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files to Create:**

```
apps/api/src/jobs/
├── services/
│   └── layer2-operational-filter.service.ts  # Layer 2 filter logic
└── __tests__/
    └── layer2-operational-filter.service.spec.ts  # Unit tests

└── layer2.ts  # Layer2Signals, Layer2FilterResult interfaces
```

**Files to Modify:**

```

├── jobs.module.ts                     # Register Layer2OperationalFilterService
└── entities/
    ├── result.entity.ts               # Add layer2_signals: JSONB field
    └── job.entity.ts                  # Add layer2_eliminated_count field

supabase/migrations/
└── [timestamp]_add_layer2_fields.sql  # Database migration

apps/api/package.json                   # Dependencies: cheerio (HTML parsing)
```

**Dependencies:**
- `cheerio` (v1.0.0+) - Fast HTML parsing for signal detection
- Existing ScraperService (reuse from Story 2.5)
- Story 3.0 configuration service (layer2_rules config)

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Test Coverage:**
- Layer2OperationalFilterService.filterUrl() with all signal types
- Company page detection: various HTML structures
- Blog freshness validation: recent posts, stale posts, no blog
- Tech stack detection: all supported tools
- Design quality scoring: modern frameworks, responsive design
- Pass/fail logic: all combinations of criteria
- Configuration loading and fallback defaults
- Error handling: scraping failures, parsing errors

**Integration Test Scenarios:**
1. **Happy Path**: Layer 1 survivor → Layer 2 scraping → All signals pass → Proceed to Layer 3
2. **Company Pages Fail**: Missing About and Team pages → Reject at Layer 2
3. **Blog Stale**: Last post 180 days ago → Reject at Layer 2
4. **Tech Stack Missing**: No analytics or marketing tools → Reject at Layer 2
5. **Design Quality Low**: Dated design, no responsive → Reject at Layer 2
6. **All Pass**: Digital-native B2B site → All signals pass → Proceed to Layer 3
7. **Performance**: Process 50 URLs in <250 seconds (5s average)
8. **Database Logging**: Verify layer2_signals stored, layer2_eliminated_count incremented

**Real-World Test URLs:**
- **Should Pass**: SaaS companies (e.g., mailchimp.com, hubspot.com, intercom.com)
- **Should Reject**: Traditional businesses (e.g., local restaurants, retail stores)
- **Edge Cases**: Personal blogs, portfolio sites, corporate sites without blogs

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Feature-based NestJS modules (Layer2OperationalFilterService under JobsModule)
- Shared types in packages/shared/src/types/layer2.ts
- Database migrations in supabase/migrations/
- Configuration integration with Story 3.0 settings

**No Detected Conflicts:**
- Story 2.6 extends Story 2.1 (database schema) and Story 2.3 (Layer 1 filter)
- Integrates with Story 2.5 (worker) for 3-tier progressive filtering
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Layer 2 service is injectable, no tight coupling

**Integration Points:**
- **Story 2.3 (Layer 1)**: Layer 2 processes only Layer 1 survivors
- **Story 2.5 (Worker)**: Worker calls Layer 2 after Layer 1 PASS
- **Story 3.0 (Settings)**: Load layer2_rules configuration
- **Story 2.4 (LLM)**: Layer 3 only called if Layer 2 passes

**Lessons Learned from Previous Stories:**

**From Story 2.3 (Pre-Filtering - Complete):**
- Use environment-aware config loading (CONFIG_PATH for production, fallback for dev)
- Validate all external config (safe-regex for patterns)
- Comprehensive input validation (null/undefined checks)
- Create database migration files in repository
- Performance optimization: cache data, minimize processing
- Aim for >85% unit test coverage

**From Story 2.5 (Worker - Ready for Merge):**
- Graceful shutdown implementation (await worker.close() in onModuleDestroy)
- Environment variable validation at startup
- Structured logging with context (URL, retry count, elapsed time)
- Error isolation (failed URLs don't crash job)
- Pause/resume support via database status checks

**Security Patterns to Apply:**
- Validate all external data (ScrapingBee responses, HTML content)
- Sanitize inputs before logging (length limits, control character stripping)
- Handle timeouts for external API calls (ScrapingBee)
- Log detailed errors server-side, generic messages to client
- Use retry logic for transient errors (network timeouts, rate limits)

- Enables: Story 2.4 refactoring (Layer 3 only processes Layer 2 survivors)

**Research:**
- Homepage scraping patterns: single-page vs full-site scraping
- Company infrastructure signals: About, Team, Contact page detection
- Blog freshness validation: common date formats, parsing strategies
- Tech stack detection: analytics (GA, Mixpanel), marketing (HubSpot, Marketo)
- Design quality indicators: CSS frameworks, responsive design, imagery

**Cost Optimization Calculation:**
- ScrapingBee homepage request: ~$0.0001/URL
- Layer 2 elimination target: 30% of Layer 1 survivors
- Example: 500 Layer 1 survivors → 150 eliminated at Layer 2
- LLM cost savings: 150 × $0.002 = $0.30
- Layer 2 cost: 500 × $0.0001 = $0.05
- Net savings: $0.25 per 500 URLs (5:1 ROI)
