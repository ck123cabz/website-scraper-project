# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project:** website-scraper-project
**Analyst:** CK

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web Application
- **Project Level:** Level 2 - Small Complete System
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Multi-user web scraping platform for guest posting classification. Modernizing existing Python Flask application to production-grade NestJS platform with task queue architecture, multi-user support, cost-optimized LLM usage, and modern React frontend.
- **Estimated Stories:** 5-15 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** 8-12 weeks (phased implementation)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield - Modernizing existing Python scraper (Flask + threading) to NestJS + BullMQ architecture
- **Existing Documentation:**
  - Technical Research: docs/research-technical-2025-10-12.md (comprehensive stack evaluation)
  - Existing Python codebase: app.py, scraper.py (for feature reference)
- **Team Size:** Solo developer (AI-assisted coding, recent Node.js experience, beginner DevOps)
- **Deployment Intent:** Production deployment on Railway PaaS (managed services preferred)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

For Level 2 projects, you will receive:

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - `docs/PRD.md`
   - Product overview and goals
   - User personas (solo developer, end users)
   - Core features and requirements
   - Success metrics
   - Out of scope (Phase 2 features)

2. **Epic Stories Document** - `docs/epic-stories.md`
   - 1-2 epics with detailed user stories
   - Acceptance criteria for each story
   - Story point estimates
   - Epic sequencing

3. **Technical Specification** - `docs/tech-spec.md`
   - System architecture (NestJS + BullMQ + Railway + Supabase)
   - Database schema
   - API endpoints
   - Integration points (ScrapingBee, Gemini, GPT)
   - Deployment architecture

### Workflow Sequence

1. **PRD Generation** (instructions-med.md)
   - Gather requirements from existing Python system
   - Define MVP feature set
   - Prioritize Phase 1 vs Phase 2 features
   - Document success criteria

2. **Epic & Story Breakdown**
   - Epic 1: Core Platform & Multi-User Foundation
   - Epic 2: Scraping Pipeline & AI Classification
   - Break down into 5-15 implementable stories

3. **Technical Specification via Solutioning Workflow**
   - Route to 3-solutioning workflow for architecture design
   - Document NestJS + BullMQ implementation patterns
   - Define database schema and migrations
   - API contract design

### Next Actions

1. ✅ Load PRD workflow with Level 2 context (instructions-med.md)
2. Begin requirements elicitation based on:
   - Existing Python functionality (reference codebase)
   - Technical research findings
   - Multi-user requirements
   - Cost optimization goals

## Special Considerations

### Cost Optimization Priority
- LLM API costs are PRIMARY concern ($50-100/month budget for APIs)
- Must implement pre-filtering to reduce LLM calls by 40-60%
- Gemini 2.0 Flash as primary (33% cheaper than GPT-4o-mini)
- Caching layer to avoid re-classification

### Scale Requirements
- Current: 5K-10K URLs per batch
- Target: Support 10K+ URLs with multiple concurrent users
- Must handle multiple large batches simultaneously

### Technical Constraints
- Solo developer maintenance (simplicity is key)
- Beginner DevOps (prefer managed platforms)
- Monthly budget: $130-150 (LLM + infrastructure)
- Railway deployment (zero DevOps complexity)

### Current System Features (Must Preserve)
- Bulk URL upload processing
- Web scraping with JS rendering (ScrapingBee)
- AI-powered classification
- Basic dashboard UI
- CSV export

## Technical Preferences Captured

### CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-10-13)
**Authentication Removed**: This is an internal collaborative tool with NO authentication. Multiple users share the same real-time view. Heavy emphasis on UI/UX transparency with live logs, progress tracking, and site-by-site visibility.

### Approved Technology Stack

**Backend & Infrastructure:**
- Backend Framework: NestJS + TypeScript
- Task Queue: BullMQ + Redis (Railway managed)
- Database: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL + **Real-time** for live updates - NO Auth)
- Deployment: Railway (PaaS)
- Monitoring: Bull Board + Railway logs

**Frontend (UI/UX HEAVY):**
- Framework: React + TypeScript
- UI Library: shadcn/ui
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (implied by shadcn)
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions for shared collaborative view
- **Focus**: Live logs, progress indicators, current site display, historical view

**External Services:**
- Scraping: ScrapingBee API (existing, 250K credits/month)
- LLM Primary: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- LLM Fallback: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Database: Supabase Cloud (NO Auth module)

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Single NestJS application (not microservices - solo developer)
- BullMQ for distributed job processing
- Redis on Railway (managed service)
- TypeScript everywhere (backend + frontend)
- RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- Real-time progress updates via Supabase Realtime

### Development Approach
- AI-assisted coding (primary development method)
- Phased implementation (MVP → incremental improvements)
- Must maintain current functionality during transition
- CI/CD via Railway automatic deployments
