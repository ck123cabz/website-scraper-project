## Expected Layer 1 Results (Domain Analysis)

### PASS Layer 1 (40-60 URLs expected)
**Categories that should pass:**
- Digital-native B2B (20 URLs) - All should PASS
- Viable B2B with Missing Signals (10 URLs) - All should PASS
- Strong Candidates (5 URLs) - All should PASS

**Expected Layer 1 PASS count:** 35 URLs (35%)

### REJECT Layer 1 (40-60 URLs expected)
**Categories that should be eliminated:**

1. **Traditional Companies (20 URLs) - REJECT**
   - Reason: Non-commercial business type (restaurants, hotels, retail)
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 1 - Traditional business type (restaurant)"

2. **Blog Platforms (20 URLs) - REJECT**
   - Reason: Blog platform domain patterns (wordpress.com, medium.com, etc.)
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 1 - Blog platform domain (medium.com)"

3. **Non-commercial TLDs (15 URLs) - REJECT**
   - Reason: Non-commercial TLD (.org, .edu, .gov)
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 1 - Non-commercial TLD (.org)"

4. **Subdomain Blogs (10 URLs) - REJECT**
   - Reason: Subdomain blog pattern (blog.*, news.*)
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 1 - Subdomain blog pattern (blog.hubspot.com)"

**Expected Layer 1 REJECT count:** 65 URLs (65%)

**Layer 1 Elimination Rate:** 65% (within 40-60% target range, actually exceeds target)

---

## Expected Layer 2 Results (Operational Validation)

**Input:** 35 URLs that passed Layer 1

### PASS Layer 2 (~70% of Layer 1 survivors = ~25 URLs)

**Categories expected to pass:**
- Strong Candidates (5 URLs) - All should PASS
  - These URLs have strong infrastructure, active blogs, professional design
  - Example: buffer.com, hootsuite.com, sproutsocial.com

- Some Digital-native B2B (estimated 15-20 URLs) - Majority should PASS
  - Established SaaS companies with good infrastructure
  - Example: slack.com, asana.com, notion.so, hubspot.com

**Expected Layer 2 PASS count:** ~25 URLs

### REJECT Layer 2 (~30% of Layer 1 survivors = ~10 URLs)

**Categories expected to be eliminated:**

1. **Viable B2B with Missing Signals (10 URLs) - REJECT**
   - Reason: Missing required pages (about/team/contact)
   - Reason: Stale blog (last post > 90 days ago)
   - Reason: Insufficient tech stack signals
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 2 - Missing required pages (1/3 found)"
   - Example reasoning: "REJECT Layer 2 - No recent blog posts (last post: 180 days ago)"

**Expected Layer 2 REJECT count:** ~10 URLs

**Layer 2 Elimination Rate:** ~29% of Layer 1 survivors (within 30% target)

---

## Expected Layer 3 Results (LLM Classification with Confidence Scoring)

**Input:** ~25 URLs that passed Layer 2

### Confidence Distribution Targets

**Total Layer 3 Classifications:** ~25 URLs

#### High Confidence (0.8-1.0): 60% = ~15 URLs
- **Classification:** Auto-approved as "suitable"
- **manual_review_required:** false
- **Expected URLs:** Strong candidates with clear guest post indicators
  - buffer.com, hootsuite.com, sproutsocial.com
  - slack.com, asana.com, notion.so, hubspot.com

#### Medium Confidence (0.5-0.79): 20% = ~5 URLs
- **Classification:** Routed to manual review queue
- **manual_review_required:** true
- **Expected URLs:** Good signals but some ambiguity
  - Companies with blog infrastructure but unclear editorial guidelines

#### Low Confidence (0.3-0.49): 15% = ~4 URLs
- **Classification:** Routed to manual review queue
- **manual_review_required:** true
- **Expected URLs:** Weak signals, ambiguous guest post indicators

#### Auto-reject (0-0.29): 5% = ~1 URL
- **Classification:** Auto-rejected as "not_suitable"
- **manual_review_required:** false
- **Expected URLs:** No guest post indicators despite passing Layer 2

**Manual Review Queue Size:** ~9 URLs (5 medium + 4 low)

## Expected Cost Metrics

### V1 Baseline (Hypothetical - All URLs Processed)

**Scraping Cost:**
- 100 URLs × $0.01/scrape = $1.00

**LLM Cost:**
- 100 URLs × $0.0004/URL = $0.04

**Total V1 Cost:** $1.04

### 3-Tier Actual Costs

**Layer 1 (Domain Analysis):**
- Cost: $0.00 (no HTTP requests, pure computation)
- Eliminations: 65 URLs

**Layer 2 (Homepage Scraping):**
- URLs scraped: 35 (Layer 1 PASS)
- Cost per scrape: $0.01
- Total scraping cost: 35 × $0.01 = $0.35
- Eliminations: 10 URLs

**Layer 3 (LLM Classification):**
- URLs classified: 25 (Layer 2 PASS)
- Gemini cost per URL: $0.0004
- Total LLM cost: 25 × $0.0004 = $0.01
- (Assuming no GPT fallbacks)

**Total 3-Tier Cost:** $0.36

### Cost Savings Analysis

**LLM Savings:**
- V1 cost: $0.04 (100 URLs)
- 3-Tier cost: $0.01 (25 URLs)
- Savings: $0.03 / $0.04 = **75% saved** ✅ (exceeds 60-70% target)

**Scraping Savings:**
- V1 cost: $1.00 (100 URLs)
- 3-Tier cost: $0.35 (35 URLs)
- Savings: $0.65 / $1.00 = **65% saved** ✅ (within 40-60% target, actually exceeds)

**Total Savings:**
- V1 total: $1.04
- 3-Tier total: $0.36
- Savings: $0.68 / $1.04 = **65% saved overall**

## Test Execution Notes

1. **Actual results may vary** based on real-time scraping data (e.g., blog freshness, page availability)
2. Some Digital-native B2B companies may be eliminated at Layer 2 if their blogs are stale or pages are missing
3. Confidence scores are determined by LLM analysis and may fluctuate
4. Cost calculations assume no GPT fallbacks; add $0.0008/URL for any GPT fallback calls
5. Manual review queue size directly impacts AC6 testing scenarios
