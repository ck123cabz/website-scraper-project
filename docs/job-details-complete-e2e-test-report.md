## Part 13: Issues Found & Recommendations

### Issues

**1. React Key Warning (Minor)**
- **Severity:** Low (development warning only)
- **Impact:** None on functionality
- **Location:** `ResultsTable` component
- **Fix:** Add unique `key` prop to mapped list items
- **Priority:** Low (can be fixed when convenient)

### Recommendations

**1. Fix React Key Warning**
```typescript
// In ResultsTable component around line 37
{results.map((result) => (
  <URLCard key={result.id} result={result} /> // Add key prop
))}
```

**2. Add Loading Skeleton (Enhancement)**
- Currently shows "Loading..." text
- Could enhance UX with skeleton loading states
- Not critical, works fine as is

**3. Test Pagination with Large Dataset (Future)**
- Current test only has 6 results (1 page)
- Recommend testing with 50+ results to verify pagination buttons
- Test "Next" and "Previous" navigation

**4. Test Real-time Updates (Future)**
- Current test verified subscription is active
- Recommend testing with actual URL processing to see updates live
- Would need a processing job to test this thoroughly
