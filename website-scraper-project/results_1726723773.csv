However, given the lack of identifiable attributes that typically characterize SaaS/business websites or news/media/blog sites, it might not fit neatly into either category without further context.

If I had to classify it based on the information provided, I would lean towards category 2 (News/media/pure blog sites) simply due to the absence of business-oriented identifiers such as services, products, or a clear business model. However, this is a tentative classification given the lack of content.
